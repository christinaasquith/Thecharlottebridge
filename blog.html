    <h2>The Charlotte Bridge Blog & Update</h1>
        <br>
        <div class="blog"> <p><strong>July 6, 2021:</strong> Hey, today we're sharing a few changes being made at The Charlotte Bridge: We created a correction policy to hold ourselves more accountable. And we are changing our editorial structure.</p>

        <p>  When we launched in the early Spring, we established Chea would be the editor/reporter, solely in charge of producing editorial content; and the other cofounders (myself, Jesse, Adam and Jack) would be on the board of directors, which governs the operations of the nonprofit. </p>
        
        <p> Today, Jack, Jesse, Adam and myself are taking ourselves off the board, and giving ourselves the title, contributing writers.</p>

        <p> Why?</p>
         
        <p>Jack, Jesse, Adam and myself have more than a century of combined journalism experience, and what we can best bring to Charlotte and The Bridge is our skills as editors, journalists and columnists. </p>
        
        <p>We removed ourselves from the board to avoid any concerns about news media leadership using it's authority to influence its journalism.</p>
        <p>Instead of governance, we're journalists, equal in power to one another. </p>
        <p>Thanks for your interests. I'll update this page and ask Chea to refernce it in her column</p>
        <p?>Thanks, Christina</p>
