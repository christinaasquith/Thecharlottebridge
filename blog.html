    <h2>The Charlotte Bridge Blog & Update</h1>
        <br>
	<div class="blog"> <p><strong>Jan 11, 2022:</strong> Hey, I loved creating the Charlotte Bridge with Chea, Jesse, Jack and Adam, but Chea really runs the journalism and I haven't been very needed/involved.</p>
		<p>So late 2021, I decided to volunteer for Charlotte's DRB, and I'll be serving there for the time being. To avoid any conflict of interest, I won't be involved in any of the internal editorial processes at The Bridge.</p>
		<p>I'm committed to transparency in government, and intend to be active at the DRB in ensuring open government, and strong communications.</p>
		<p>Thanks to everyone who supports the Charlotte Bridge, and best wishes to Chea and the team.</p>

        <div class="blog"> <p><strong>July 6, 2021:</strong> Hey, today we're sharing a few changes being made at The Charlotte Bridge: We created a correction policy to hold ourselves more accountable. And we are changing our editorial structure.</p>

        <p>  When we launched in the early Spring, we established Chea would be the editor/reporter, solely in charge of producing editorial content; and the other cofounders (myself, Jesse, Adam and Jack) would be on the board of directors, which governs the operations of the nonprofit. </p>
        
        <p> Today, Jack, Jesse, Adam and myself are taking ourselves off the board, and giving ourselves the title: contributing writers.</p>

        <p> Why?</p>
         
        <p>Jack, Jesse, Adam and myself have more than a century of combined journalism experience, and what we can best bring to Charlotte and The Bridge is our skills as editors, journalists and columnists. </p>
        
        <p>We removed ourselves from the board so we could report and write, without any potential concerns about influencing content by wielding a position of power over the journalist.</p>
        <p>The Charlotte Bridge is now a network of independent journalists, equal in power to one another. We occasionally may team up on articles, but we publish independently from one another.   </p>
        
        <p>Thanks, Christina Asquith</p>
