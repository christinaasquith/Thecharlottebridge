      <p>We try our best, but mistakes happen. And unfortunately, "not only is it easy to be wrong on the internet, it's profitable", as Jeremy Arnold of Save Journalism says.</p>
      <p>  If we mess up, not only we will correct it- <em>we'll make amends</em> by buying you a $25 gift card to the county store of your choice: Carrie's Spear Street or Old Brick.</p>
      <p>Please reach out in an email to all 5 cofounders about it. We'll get it corrected as soon as possible. </p>
