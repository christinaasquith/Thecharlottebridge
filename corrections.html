      <p>We try our best, but mistakes happen. We can get facts wrong, and present bad takes. And unfortunately, "not only is it easy to be wrong on the internet, it's profitable", as Jeremy Arnold of Save Journalism says.</p>
      <p>  So, if we mess up, not only will we try to correct it- <em>we'll make amends</em> by buying you a $25 gift card to the county store of your choice: Carrie's Spear Street or Old Brick.</p>
      <p>Please reach out in one email to all 5 cofounders (emails on homepage). We'll get it addressed as soon as possible. </p>
