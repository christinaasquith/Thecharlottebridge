      <p>Accuracy and transparency are important to us. We try our best, but mistakes happen.  </p>
      <p>If you see something in a story that's just plain wrong, or if you feel like a story is misleading, one-sided, or otherwise contrary to our mission, please let us know.</p>
      <p> If we mess up, we will correct it publicly. Furthermore, The Charlotte Bridge <em>will make amends</em> by buying you a $25 gift card to the county store of your choice: Carrie's Spear Street or Old Brick.</p>
      <p>Please reach out to chea@thecharlottebridge.org, or email any or all of the cofounders (emails on homepage). We'll get it addressed as soon as possible. </p>
