<h2>Our History</h2>

    <p>After local journalist Chea Water Evans came under pressure for her diligent reporting on conflicts of interest in town, she quit. Friends Jack Fairweather, Adam Davidson, Christina Asquith and Jesse Wegman (also journalists) reached out to create a Substack to continue her coverage.</p>
    <p>Read about our founding in <a href=https://vtdigger.org/2021/04/13/frustrated-with-one-local-newspaper-prominent-charlotte-journalists-help-start-another/ target="_blank">VT Digger</a></p>
    <p>Our mission is to produce the kind of news Charlotters have clearly said they need: coverage of town meetings, municipal governance, elected officials, conflicts of interest and all the other fun things that go on behind the scenes in a small town.</p> 
    <p>Our values: accuracy, transparency, objectivity, accountability and fairness</p>  
 <br>
<h2>  The Charlotte Bridge operates on simple core principles of journalism.</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Maintain editorial independence</li>
  <li>Avoid conflict of interest</li>
  <li>Communicate clear staff accountability practices</li>
  <li>Be transparent with readers</li>
</ul>
  <p>
    The core principles of journalism can be learned and followed by anyone, without acquiring a journalism degree, or having the backing of a massive organization: <em>Readers should feel confident that an article was written in the best interest of the public and not, secretly, in support of some private interest.</em></p>
