<h1>Our History</h1>

    <p>Charlotte, Vermont, is a special place. More than 250 years after it was founded, in 1762, it remains a picturesque, tight-knit farming community on the shores of Lake Champlain, between the Green Mountains and the Adirondack Mountains. It is home to roughly 3,700 people -- people who care about the land and about each other. Charlotte's residents pride themselves on a long tradition of civic engagement.</p>
     
    <p>While unique, Charlotte's challenges may feel similar to many towns in Vermont and around the country: How best can deeply-rooted, diverse communities continue to thrive in the twenty-first century? How should differing visions about housing, wildlife, natural resources, schools, town governance and other issues be resolved? How can citizens stay informed, and exchange opinions, all while preserving civil discourse, and celebrating the many things that strengthens the community?</p>  
    <p>In order for any community to take on any of these challenges -- especially in the midst of big changes -- a vibrant, trusted and free press is essential. In an ideal world, thoughtful, purposeful news can co-exist and thrive in tandem with the community it covers.</p>
    <p>In the spring of 2021, over several gatherings around town, in gardens beheath the Green Mountains, circling bonfires, with lively discussion and passionate opinions, a group formed to support the principles of great journalism. Chea Water Evans, a highly respected local journalist, heeded the call to produce the kind of news Charlotters have clearly said they need: coverage of town meetings, municipal governance, elected officials, and all the other fun things that go on behind the scenes in a small town. </p>
 <br>
<h1>  The Charlotte Bridge operates on simple core principles of journalism.</h1>
  <p>
    The core principles of journalism can be learned and followed by anyone, and they're really important to us. So important, in fact, that we're basing our entire organization on them and hoping you'll join us. Citizens can follow these principles right along with The Charlotte Bridge without acquiring a journalism degree, without the backing of a massive organization, and there's no need for years of training. They boil down to one idea: <em>readers should feel confident that an article was written in the best interest of the public and not, secretly, in support of some private interest.</em></p>

<p>Journalists and managers of journalistic institutions are, of course, fallible like all human beings. They are capable of confusing their own private interests with those of the general public. Journalistic best practice involves clear rules and policies that protect the reader and the integrity of the news product.</p>

<h2>The Charlotte Bridge Best Practices:</h2>

<p><span class="lead">Editorial independence</span> The editorial team, led by the editor, is empowered to make all editorial decisions about what stories to cover and how to cover them. A news team needs to feel confident that they can report—fearlessly and fairly—on any topic they deem to be in the public interest. They should pursue the truth and report it without fear interference or retribution. The publisher and board of directors sets the overall mission and long-term goals but does not interfere with the editorial product. If they have story ideas, corrections, or other suggestions, these are made in the same way any reader would.</p>

<p><span class="lead">Conflict of interest</span> If an individual, or someone close to that individual, might personally benefit from a topic covered, they must recuse themselves from any discussion, deliberation or decision regarding that coverage. They must not make any story suggestions, edit suggestions, or in any way impact the coverage. If questionable, we err on the side of overly disclosing potential conflict of interest.</p>

<p><span class="lead">News team accountability</span> From time to time, reporters and editors may need to be reprimanded or, even, fired for their behavior in the workplace. However, in a journalistic institution, there is always a concern that the human resource (HR) process is being used as retribution against news coverage or to silence an especially diligent news team. For this reason, HR processes in a news operation need to be especially well-handled in a deliberate and transparent manner to ensure there is no retribution or silencing, or even the appearance of such editorial interference. As any journalist knows: one can build trust over decades and lose it in an afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="lead">Transparency</span> We believe deeply in transparency. There needs to be little division between the actions of the news operations and what the public sees. Local news works well when news outlets operate under a policy of tenacity with transparency. Conflicts of interest are expected; but they are surmountable when clear procedures and expectations are in place to avoid biased reporting.</p>

<p>Our goal is to create a news organization with as much transparency as possible. This means keeping our code open source on GitHub, and making public all of our financial information-- including donors, operating costs, and salaries. It also means having a system in place for editorial staff to relay conflict-of-interest concerns to board members.</p>

<p>We are committed to transparency and journalistic integrity and we look forward to bringing you news from Charlotte as soon as it happens.</p>

<p>Thank you! Chea, Christina, Adam, Jack and Jesse</p>
